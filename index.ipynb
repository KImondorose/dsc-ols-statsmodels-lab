You worked with the height-weight data set to understand the process and all of the necessary steps that must be performed. In this lab , you'll explore a slightly more complex example to study the impact of spending on different advertising channels on total sales.\n","\n","## Objectives\n","\n","You will be able to:\n","* Perform a linear regression using statsmodels\n","* Evaluate a linear regression model by using statistical performance metrics pertaining to overall model and specific parameters\n","* Determine if a particular set of data exhibits the assumptions of linear regression\n","\n","## Let's get started\n","\n","In this lab, you'll work with the \"Advertising Dataset\", which is a very popular dataset for studying simple regression. [The dataset is available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/purbar/advertising-data), but we have downloaded it for you. It is available in this repository as `advertising.csv`. You'll use this dataset to answer this question:\n","\n","> Which advertising channel has the strongest relationship with sales volume, and can be used to model and predict the sales?\n","\n","## Step

You used statsmodel to perform linear regression and evaluated your models using statistical metrics. You also looked for the regression assumptions before and after the analysis phase. Finally, you created some visualizations of your models and checked their goodness of fit.
